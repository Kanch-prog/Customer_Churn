Project Description: Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction

Telecom companies face the challenge of retaining customers, as churn significantly impacts business performance. This project aims to analyze a telecom churn dataset to understand factors contributing to churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. By uncovering insights and implementing targeted strategies, the telecom company can improve customer retention and business outcomes. Aims to provide actionable insights and predictive models to help the telecom company reduce churn, retain valuable customers, and drive sustainable growth.

The dataset used for analysis is sourced from Kaggle's Telecom Churn Datasets https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets/code. It contains comprehensive information on customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, and churn status, providing valuable insights into customer behavior.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
  Handle missing values and ensure data quality through imputation techniques.
  Encode categorical variables and engineer additional features for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualize distributions and correlations of features with churn.
  Identify cohorts with high revenue generation and low churn rates.

Model Development:
  Build predictive models, starting with logistic regression, to forecast churn.
  Utilize standard scaling and one-hot encoding for model compatibility.
Model Evaluation:
  Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Tools and Technologies:
  Python programming language with libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
  Visual Studio Code for analysis and visualization.
  
Key Findings and Recommendations:
  Maximum Revenue Cohort:
    Identify the state, time of day, and service plan combination contributing to the highest revenue.
  Low Churn Cohort:
    Identify cohorts with low churn rates for potential expansion opportunities.
    Replicate successful strategies from these cohorts in other regions or customer segments.
  Poor Performing Areas and Reasons:
    Explore relationships between churn and other variables to identify areas of poor performance.
    Investigate reasons such as service quality, pricing, or customer satisfaction issues contributing to poor performance.
  Advanced Analysis - Predictive Modeling:
    Implement advanced predictive modeling to forecast churn based on customer usage patterns.
    Target at-risk customers with personalized retention strategies, such as discounts or incentives, to mitigate churn.
